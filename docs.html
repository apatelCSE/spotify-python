<h1>Spotify Artist Anthology</h1>

<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The main use case I'd like to create this for is a Bollywood singer who 
        sings in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Odia, Nepali, Bhojpuri, Bengali. 
        I'm trying to figure out the best way to search for songs based on the 
        first word of the song. One idea I have is to ask the user for the 
        language they want the playlist to be restricted to (have one playlist 
        for the artist's Tamil songs, one for Hindi songs, etc.). I could then 
        load the language's dictionary and search by each word in the dictionary. 
        This poses a few obvious issues, the most obvious being the sheer volume 
        and extensive search involved with searching every single word in one 
        language. There are also quite a few languages out there, and this 
        implementation would require storing every language's wordset. Another 
        issue that arises with that is the multiple spellings of one word in 
        Romanized text. Perhaps there could be a way to pull that information 
        from a different API.</li>
    <li>Better idea: Traverse through each letter and while there are still songs 
        per that letter by the provided artist, traverse through the alphabet 
        again: A -> Aa -> Aaa -> Aab. This would work for all languages now 
        because everything has to be Romanized for Spotify (would this only work) 
        for USA users? Hmm...). We don't have to store all those languages now. 
        The search time is still exhaustive, however.
        search(artist)
            for letter in alphabet
                runsearch(letter)
        
        runsearch (artist, letterstring)
            if (search results with letterstring)
                numresults = number of search results
                for songs in search results
                    addsong(song)
                if numresults > limit_of_search_results
                    for letter in alphabet
                        runsearch(artist, letterstring + letter)

        addsong (song)
            if URI already in playlist
                return
            else
                add to playlist
    </li>
    <li>One problem I'm running into during the debugging process (good news, I 
        can create playlists!) is that this search is crazy-exhaustive. There 
        are too many results, and not enough with the correct artist, which is 
        weird because the search should be specific to the correct-matching 
        artist and search string. Instead, we're getting to the point where the 
        search string is "aaaaaaaaa" and there are still 50+ results...

        I just learned about the "offset" feature in search, so I could try to 
        offset my searches instead of recursing with the next letter, which should 
        hopefully bring the runtime down.

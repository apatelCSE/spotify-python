<h1>Spotify Artist Anthology</h1>

<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The main use case I'd like to create this for is a Bollywood singer who 
        sings in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Odia, Nepali, Bhojpuri, Bengali. 
        I'm trying to figure out the best way to search for songs based on the 
        first word of the song. One idea I have is to ask the user for the 
        language they want the playlist to be restricted to (have one playlist 
        for the artist's Tamil songs, one for Hindi songs, etc.). I could then 
        load the language's dictionary and search by each word in the dictionary. 
        This poses a few obvious issues, the most obvious being the sheer volume 
        and extensive search involved with searching every single word in one 
        language. There are also quite a few languages out there, and this 
        implementation would require storing every language's wordset. Another 
        issue that arises with that is the multiple spellings of one word in 
        Romanized text. Perhaps there could be a way to pull that information 
        from a different API.</li>
